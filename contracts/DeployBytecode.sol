       * How are bytes stored in Solidity:
       * In memory the `bytes` is stored by having first the length of the `bytes` and then the data,
       * this results in the following schema: `<32-bytes length><data>` at the location where bytecode points to.
       *
       * Now if we want to use the data with `CREATE`, we first point to the start of the raw data, which is after the length.
       * Therefore, we add 32 (the space required for the length) to the location stored in the bytecode variable.
       * This is the first parameter. For the second parameter, we read the length from memory using `mload`.
       * As the length is the first 32 bytes at the location of `bytecode`, we can read the length by calling `mload(bytecode)`.
